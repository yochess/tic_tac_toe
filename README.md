# tic_tac_toe

The goal is to implement a minimax algorithm which I know nothing about.  
  
So far my primitive algorithm does 3 things:  
1. go for an immediate win  
2. block an immediate win  
3. otherwise make a random move  
  
I know I can add in new steps of creating and blocking a fork (look for two 2 in a rows) as the next priority.  
However I think the minimax only requires a win and a loss condition as heuristics for the base case.
